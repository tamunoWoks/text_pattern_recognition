## Phone Number Detector (Two Versions)
This project demonstrates two ways to identify and extract phone numbers in text using Python.

1. **`isPhoneNumber.py`** – A manual implementation that checks each character to validate the phone number format.
2. **`isPhoneNumber2.py`** – A regex-based implementation using Python’s built-in `re` module for faster and more concise pattern matching.

### Overview:
Both scripts are designed to detect phone numbers written in the standard **U.S. format**: For example: `415-555-1011` or `212-999-8888`.
